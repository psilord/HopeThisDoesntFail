* Considerations (Get promoted to Design section on acceptance)
- "No Miss" Bonus every 10 areas. (run by psilord)
- Mirroring feature with hidden point items as differences?
- Zooming in/out (was mostly for helicopter based play - not thrilled anymore RB)
- Single animated water tile as base layer (sinus waves) with land overlays
- Focus beam/slow Spread shot/normal
- 8 way digital movement with adjustable gate (square or octagon)
- Extend system every x points then y points thereafter
- Chance to recapture powerups after player death
- Max Power powerups as a rarity (perhaps hidden)
- Hidden bonus items in general (shoot pieces of scenery)
- 2+ Player ships
- Simple difficult mode (more enemy shots, suicide shots, aimed shots, shot speed)
