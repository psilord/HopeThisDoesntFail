# HopeThisDoesntFail
A small game between friends.

Rectangular bricks are in the center of the screen with some
interstitial space and then a border all around the screen. 4 paddles
exist in the space, Two vertical ones on the left and right sides and
two horizontal ones in the top and bottom space. The top/bottom
paddles move in unison with left/right arrows and the left/right paddles
move up/down with the up/down arrows. They are stopped by the edge of
the border.

A ball enters the board, bounces off a brick deleting it and if you hit it
with the paddle it'll reflect back properly. When all bricks are gone the
game is won. If the ball hits the border, it shrinks, moving the paddles 
inward and the border inward. If the paddle or the border hits a brick, you
lose.
