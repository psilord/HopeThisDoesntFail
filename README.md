## First Light - Proof of Concept

An STG with classic elements and new ideas. A small project to evaluate, test, and develop First Light in a "trial by fire" scenario.

A *Common Lisp* game.

## Planning

 - 5 - 6 Levels
 - 4 Minutes Per Level (not counting boss)
 - Around 20 total enemies with new ones revealed each level to keep things fresh.
 - Bosses with 2 phases (changing firing patterns per phase)
 - Glorious klaxon and banner warning the player before a boss. (diagonal scrolling or go home)
 - Simple movement paths for enemies and a way to layer the paths side
   by side for squadron attacks. Easy mirroring of paths and varying left and right with timer.
 - Player movement offered as square gate or octagon gate.
 - Player weapon fires fast enough to move with player (no 45 degree nonsense while moving, unless special weapon)
 - No magic girls, military only.

## The Idea Bin
Clown shot bullets used tastefully. (Bullets split and fork, zig zag, circle back then resume, sine wave)
